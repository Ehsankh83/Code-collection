            <h2 class="ni">
                
                in the 7th meeting of our web class we started learning <span id="one">css</span> <br> so expect some weird fonts and colors
            
            </h2>

        </header>

            <section>

                <h2 class="san"><i>so what are html , css and javascript exactly ?</i></h2>

                <p class="yon">
                    let me make an example of it , <br>

                    imagine : site is like a person and Html is the skeleton of that site ,<br>

                    so css will be the appearance and his face <br>

                    <i id="two">in terms of this ,what is javascript then ?</i> <br>

                    <span id="three">javascript is the soul and personality of that person </span>
                </p>

            </section>

            <section>

                <h2 class="go"><i>now we know some things about css and html </i></h2>

                <p class="roku">

                    this question might come in your mind : Do they get wroten in the same place ?<br>

                    yes , they can be wroten in the same place but your site is gonna have 20000 lines and will be very disturbing <br>

                    so what we do is , we open another file to write css code in it and we'll link it to the HTML file  

                </p>

            </section>

            <section>

                <h2 class="nana"><i>so css and html codes are similar to eachother ?</i></h2>

                <p class="hachi">
                    
                    no , css has its own style of writing. <span id="five">(get it ? css ? style ? ok,nevermind)</span><br>

                    html is like this : (tag) content (/tag) <br>

                    and css will be like this : property:value;

                </p>
